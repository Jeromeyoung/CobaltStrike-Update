## Introduce

> Cobatstrike is a platform wide multi-party cooperative post penetration attack framework based on Java. Cobaltstrike integrates the functions of port forwarding, port scanning, socket proxy, lifting rights, fishing, remote control Trojan horse and so on. The tool covers almost all the technical links needed in the apt attack chain.
> Use cloud functions to avoid traceability
> Using docker container is fast and convenient
> Use the python script I wrote to avoid privacy disclosure and malicious attacks

## Quickly create

> If you want to use cloud functions, you must use port 443 inside the container

```bash
docker run -it \
   --name cs \
   -e "passwd=e9PrFYtrPFD2U" \
   -e "server_ip=1.1.1.1" \
   -e "server_port=33009" \
   -e "aliasname=Bing Wallpaper" \
   -e "dname=CN=www.microsoft.com,  OU=Microsoft Corporation, O=Microsoft Corporation, L=Redmond, S=WA, C=US" \
   -p 443:443 \
   -p 443:443/udp \
   -p 80:80 \
   -p 33009:33009 \
   -p 33009:33009/udp \
   xrsec/cobaltstrike:4.4
   
# "tips server_ip=192.168.0.1" | "tips server_ip=86.66.66.66"
# -p 80:80 : http
# -p 443:443 : https
# -p 33009:33009 : admin
# -e "passwd=e9PrFYtrPFD2U" : your password
